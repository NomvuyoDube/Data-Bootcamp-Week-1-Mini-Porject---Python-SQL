# Data-Bootcamp-Week-1-Mini-Porject---Python-SQL
Week 1 of the Data Science Bootcamp: Python + SQL for delivery data analysis – Excel on steroids!  Filter, summarize, and explore delays like a (semi)pro:)


# Week 1 Mini Project: Python + SQL 

## What’s This?
Week 1 of the 8-week Data Science Bootcamp! We jumped into Python and SQL to play with delivery data – basically Excel on steroids.

## The Mission
- Import delivery data   
- Filter out delayed deliveries  
- Summarize delays by city   

## Tools Used
- Python 3 (in VS Code)
- DuckDB (SQL inside Python)  
- `io` for handling CSVs  

## How It Works
1. Load the CSV into Python  
2. Turn it into a DuckDB table  
3. Filter where `delay_minutes > 0`  
4. Count delays and calculate average per city  
5. Print results  

## Why It’s Cool
- No Excel limits, full Python + SQL power  
- Quick insights into delivery delays by city  
- Shows how Python + SQL = data analysis superpowers
